My Spirit will not **contend** with humans forever, for they are **mortal**;  
their days will be a hundred and twenty years.

The **Nephilim** were on the earth in those days - and also afterward - when the 
sons of God went to the daughters of the humans and **had children by** them.  
They were the heroes of **old**, **men of renown**.

The LORD saw how great the **wickedness** of the human **race** had become on the earth,
and that every **inclination** of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time.

I will **wipe from** the face of the earth the human race I have created.

Noah was a **righteous** man, **blameless** among the people of his time.
