Thus the heavens and the earth were completed **in all their vast array**.

Now no **shrub** had yet appeared on the earth and no plant had yet **sprung up**.

A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was seperated into four **headwater**s.

The gold of that land is good; **aromatic** **resin** and **onyx** are also there.

The second river is the Gihon; it **winds through** the entire land of Cush.

The name of the third river is the **Tigris**; it runs along the east side of Ashur.

The fourth river is the **Euphrates**.
