Let there be a **vault** between the waters to seperate water from water.

Let the water **teem with** living creatures.

Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the **livestock**, 
the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.

Let us make **mankind** in our image, in our **likeness**.

Be **fruitful** and increase in number; fill the earth and **subdue** it.
